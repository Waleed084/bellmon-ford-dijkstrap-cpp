both algo finds lowest Single source shortest paths
Always start from non-Infinite nodes


Source = 0
other edges = infinite
Vertix = V

Dijkstra's algo does not solve -ve Vs
Bellman Ford algo relaxes every edge, V-1 times 
to find -ve edge cycle check v-1+1
(Graph drawn V-1 times)



if A+V<B
A + V = B
